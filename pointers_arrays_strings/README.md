# Pointers, Arrays and Strings


This repository is part of the `low-programming` parent repository focused on C programming. This repository us dedicated to mastering key concepts in C: **POINTERS**, **ARRAYS** and **STRINGS**. Understanding these fundamental concepts is crucial for  writing efficent and effective code in C. Without that you can't properly understand your code. This repository will also hold all the tasks I had to do regarding pointers, arrays and strings.

## Glossary

  - **Pointers:** A variable that stores the memory address of another variable, allowing direct access to the value stored at that address.

  - **Pointer Arithmetic:** Operations that involve manipulating pointers to navigate through memory, *such as incrementing a pointer to access the next element in an array.* 

  - **Array:** A collection of elements of the **same** type, stored in *contiguous memory locations*, accessibles via **indices**.

  - **String:** A sequence of characters terminated by a **null character (`'\0'`)**, often implemented as an *array* of `char` 

  - **Dynamic Memory Allocation:**[See README.md dedicated to memory allocation](https://github.com/ArcturusSky/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/malloc_free/README.md)

## Pointers

**Definition:** A pointer is a **special variable** that stores the memory adress of another variable. 
Instead of holdinf a typical data value, a pointer holds the location of where that data value resides in memory.
This allows direct access to the variable's value by referencing its memory adress

### Why using pointers?:

	**Efficiency:** Pointers allow direct access to memory adresses, enabling quicker read and write operations compared to accessing array elements through index calculations

### How `function` works

**Use:** 
	
**Template for `function` function :** 

  ```c 
  

  ``` 
	
**Return:** 

*Exemple:*

````c

````
