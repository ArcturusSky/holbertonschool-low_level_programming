# Introduction to Pointers, Arrays, and Strings in C

This repository serves me as an introduction to fundamental concepts of pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language. Seen during the Holberton School fundamental program. (Here this is the Week 4, Project 2)

## What are Pointers?

Definition: 
Pointers are variables that store memory addresses as their values. 

Types and memories:
Each type of variable has a size in MEMORY. BUT a pointer is ALWAYS considered as a long int.

## Arrays in C

Definition:
Arrays allow you to store multiple values of the same type under a single name. 

## Strings in C

Strings in C are represented as arrays of characters terminated by a null character '\0'. 

## Difference between Arrays and Strings

Basically they are quite the same. An Array will store multiple values of the same type. The String is the same BUT only Char. Btw an Array doesn't finish with '/0' while a string does.
